questions regarding the effectness of a direct marketing campaigns of a 
Portuguese banking institution.

in the same directory as this file.

Methodology: Used proc freq to find the frequency of custmoer demographic
data, using the result to draw a picture of the customers of the bank.
Limitations: Since there are limited demographic variables in the dataset,
it would be better to include more attributes for more accurate results.
Follow-up Steps: Add more client demographic data into the data set or combine
with other data results of bank clients analysis.

Methodology: Use PROC glm to run the logistic regression to find out the
exact relationship and whether this is significant in reality.
Limitations: There are many'unkonwn' and 'other' values in the data set.
This will effect the accurace of the result because of the poor data quality.
Follow-up Steps: Find out a propriate value instead of using 'unknown' value

Methodology: Use proc glm to build a regression model to find out the relationship. 

Limitations:Since consumer price is only one of the social and economic context 
attributes.This analysis result may not be enough to undersatand how would the 
social and economic context affect the marketing campaign.
Follow-up Steps:Include more social and economic context attributes in the model.
